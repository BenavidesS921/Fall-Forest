# Fall-Forest
Chapter 12 Recursion Lab

# How does recursion allow small changes to ripple through the whole structure?
Recursion calls upon itself, anything that changes within that recursion call can affect the whole program.

# Where else in nature or daily life do you see recursive patterns?
# Explain how your code mirrors a natural process.
We see repetitive patterns every day. We eat, sleep, and repeat until our lives come to an end. 
It’s the universe’s most basic rhythm, one that continues until it eventually stops. My code reflects the same idea, 
much like how real trees live and change. While not identical, it shares a key part of their life cycle, 
adapting to the seasons. In fall and winter, the tree loses its leaves, and in the spring and summer, 
it grows and thrives again.

# What did you learn about recursion from simulating something organic?
Recursion is a form of repetition. If nothing prevents a recursive method from calling itself, 
it will continue infinitely. Similarly, trees follow their natural cycles until something interrupts them.
